Blendy: A simple CLI for image manipulation

Just a simple project for learning purposes, if you see that something could be improved, please open an issue, submit a pull request, or concact me, that'd be really helpful ^^

an example of how to use it:

```rust
blendy input.png output.png --blur 22 --invert --grayscale --rotate right
```

(there's no arguments order, i couldn't figure out how to implement it with clap)
